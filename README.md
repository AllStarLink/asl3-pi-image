# ASL3 Pi Image
This repo and its .img.xz output contains only the elements for ASL3 that
are used for the installer media of the "turnkey" Pi appliance.
In general, any issues
with ASL3 should be filed at [ASL3](https://github.com/AllStarLink/ASL3)
or [app_rpt](https://github.com/AllStarLink/app_rpt).

Only open an issue with this repository if you have been instructed
to do so by an ASL developer or the ASL Helpdesk.
